# Async Worker (Alpha)

Allows for the simple creation and management of longstanding asyncio workers.

## Installation
    
    pip install git+git://github.com:amustafa/async_worker.git

## Design Details

The decorator wraps a single unit of work. This unit of work could be anything, such as pulling 
from a socket or reading from a file. This unit of work is passed to a "worker" that will call 
the function repeatedly until it is told to stop. The class handles starting and stoping the 
worker task.

## How to Use: Directly

    from async_worker import AsyncWorker
    class ExampleDirect(object):                                 
                                                                 
    def __init__(self):                                          
        self.count = 0                                           
        self.add_to_count_worker = AsyncWorker(self.add_to_count)
                                                                 
    def add_to_count(self):                                      
        self.count += 1                                          


and then when you're ready to start the worker.

    w = ExampleDirect()
    w.add_to_count_worker.start()

and when you're done or want the worker to stop.

    w.add_to_count_worker.stop()

## How to Use: Decorator


    class ExampleDecorator(object):

        def __init__(self):
            self.count = 0

        @async_worker
        def adder(self):
            """
            Adds 1 to the count and then sleeps and does not sleep. Function
            is synchronous.
            """
            self.count += 1
and
    
    w = ExampleDecorator(object)
    w.adder.start()
    w.adder.stop()
